excerpt: Crime in Gotham is at an all-time High. Join us this Wednesday night in a
  hands-on, interactive design sprint, where we work in small groups to brainstorm
  and prototype to help Batman save Gotham. Also, this is a good opportunity to meet
  others if you're on the fence about becoming a mentor or mentee.
